[INSTRUCTION]
Answer the following questions as accurately as possible using the provided functions.

[AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS]
The function definitions below are in the following format:
<functionName>: <description>
 - <parameterName>: <parameterDescription>
 - ...

{{$Tools}}
[END AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS]

[USAGE INSTRUCTIONS]
To use the functions, specify a JSON blob representing an action. The JSON blob should contain an "action" key with the name of the function to use, and an "parameters" key with a JSON object of string values to use when calling the function.
Do not call functions directly; they must be invoked through an action.
The "parameters" value should always include an "input" key, even if the input value is empty. Additional keys in the "parameters" value should match the defined [PARAMETERS] of the named "action" in [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS].
Dictionary values in "parameters" must be strings and represent the actual values to be passed to the function.
Ensure that the $JSON_BLOB contains only a SINGLE action; do NOT return multiple actions.
IMPORTANT: Use only the available functions listed in the [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS] section. Do not attempt to use any other functions that are not specified.

Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:

{
  "tool": "FUNCTION.NAME",
  "parameters": {"INPUT": "some input", "PARAMETER_NAME": "some value", "PARAMETER_NAME_2": 42}
}

Use following as additional info:
